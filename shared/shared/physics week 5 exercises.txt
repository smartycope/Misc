week 5 physics exercises

Note: 




1. newtonsLaw(f=1, a=8)
    -> 0.125
    that's in kilograms, cause f is in newtons (kilograms/(meters/second^2))
ANSWER: d is pretty close

2. well drag = - whateverTheHeckBIs * velocity, so... I have no idea cause no said what b ever was, and nothing that I can thing of starts with a b. Barycenter???
*insert rant about single letter variables*
Oh wait, I don't need that. I can just subtract.
newtonsLaw(f=3651, m=1250) - 2.60
    -> 0.32079999999999975
    That's in m/s^2, so...
newtonsLaw(a=0.32, m=1250)
    -> 400.9999999999997
ANSWER: d


3. well I could put this into vectors and do it that way, but it's just 78 - 26, and pointing up because the up vector is bigger
ANSWER: c

4. I'm assuming this is in space, because space in my mind is the default for all physics questions (space is cool)
I'm gonna say a, because b is not true, unless it's in atmosphere and it keeds a force to keep it going, a is true, and c is equal to a, and never practially applicable.
ANSWER: a

5. well not a or b, cause it's AFTER contact
so c assuming atmosphere, and d assuming no atmosphere
ANSWER: c or d (c?)

6. Given the data provided, I got a value of 31.0 for the tension on string 2 (honestly, I just put it into an all-purpose trig solve program I wrote a while ago, and assume that's correct, cause I forgot how to do it by hand, gotta love programming) and so I'm assuming that the total tension equals the force required to hold it up, so assuming earth gravity....
newtonsLaw(f=23 + 31, a=9.8)
    -> 5.5102040816326525
which is not an answer, so I don't know. I mostly trust my trig solver, and my total tension logic seems reasonable, and 9.8 for gravity seems reasonable...
ANSWER: e???

7. well, 
newtonsLaw(m=3, a=3)
    -> 9
Which means... something.

8. newtonsLaw(m=2, a=2.5)
    -> 5.0
I can't see any reason this *isn't* right, because we're ignoring friction because we're not given any value for the coefficient of either friction. So sure.

9. newtonsLaw(m=2, f=Vector2D(4, 40, False).x)
    -> 1.53208888623796
    newtonsLaw(m=2, f=4)
    -> 2.0
so... add them together maybe?
ANSWER: c

10. newtonsLaw(m=5, f=Vector2D(14, 35, False).x)
    -> 2.29362572400918
and then if I want to assume I did the previous question right, then I need to add
    newtonsLaw(m=5, f=14)
    -> 2.8
and you get 5.09N * x = 0m/s^2?
wait, constant speed? 
umm... how would you do this then?...
NO! It's unsolvable without knowing the value of the constant speed, because if it's going faster, then it... has the same *coefficient* of friction, dang it.
hmmmmmmmm
I'm running out of time. Oh well. I'll figure it out eventually.

    


The python function:

def newtonsLaw(f=None, m=None, a=None) -> 'The one not specified':
    # F = ma
    if have(f, m) and need(a):
        return f/m
    elif have(m, a) and need(f):
        return m*a
    elif have(f, a) and need(m):
        return f/a
    else:
        raise TypeError(f"Wrong number of parameters, bub")
