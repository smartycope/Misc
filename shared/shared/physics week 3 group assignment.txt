Copeland Carter - Week 3 "Vector Addition Simulation" homework
I did this assignment myself (I have no group)
Last week I just typed my work out and I got full marks for it, so I assume you're okay with it. Writing is the worst (I'm a computer major).

1. 200 km / 3 hr ⋍ b. 67.0 km/hr (speed doesn't care what direction you're going)
ANSWER: B

2. displacement(via pythagorean theorem) = 100*√2 km / 3 hr ⋍ a. 47.0 km/hr
ANSWER: A

3. E. None of the above. Because the answer is 0 km/hr, cause your displacement is 0.
ANSWER: E

4. 100 + (r*cos(theta)) = 200 km.
ANSWER: C

5. r*sin(theta) = 100*√3 km ⋍ c, it's only 3ish off.
ANSWER: C

6. sqrt(200^2 + (100*√3)^2) = 100*√7 ⋍ c, only 4 ish off
ANSWER: C

7. atan((√3)/2) ⋍ 40.9° = I have no idea. Uhhh... e. none of the above?? 
ANSWER: E?


not 8. If I'm understanding these instructions right... 35 + 25*√2 km ⋍ d. 70.4 km
Just kidding, I realized I didn't understand the instructions right. It's displacement, not distance.
So... 

not 9. sqrt(70^2 + 50^2) km = 10*√74 km ⋍ 86.0 km??

At about here, I spent about 4 hours banging my head against the problem and getting different answers, so I gave up and wrote a program to do it (I understand programming way better than I understand math).

8. Here's what I did to get the answer:
    a = Vector(70, 60, radians=False)
    b = Vector(50, 180 + 45, radians=False)
    ans = addHeadToTail(a, b)
    ans
        -> Vector(r=10*sqrt(74), θ=asin(-5*sqrt(37)/74 + 7*sqrt(222)/148), θ°=17.0805824370233)
    ans.toxy()[0].evalf()
        -> 82.2289915411259
    The total westward displacement is equal to the x component of the vector resulting from adding the 2 vectors together
    So... e, I guess? I tested my class, and I'm reasonably confident in it, it's pretty simple... And I *think* I'm interpretting the angle of "southwest" right... So I'm gonna go with e, cause I don't want to think about this anymore.
ANSWER: E

9. Same thing as the last problem, but with the y value instead of the x value
    (assuming the last question's input)
    ans.toxy()[1].evalf()
        -> 25.2664392055833
ANSWER: B

10. Just get the added value's θ value.
    (assuming the last question's input)
    ans.degθ.evalf()
        -> 17.0805824370233
    And now I'm suddenly less confident in my program.
    But I'm also reeeeeally sick of working on this assignment, so
